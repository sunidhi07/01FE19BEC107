# GCD

A brief description of what this project does and  it's for Design and construct a synthesizable Finite State Machine and Datapath which computes the greatest common denominator (GCD) of two numbers numbers and output the binary value of the greatest common divisor of those two numbers.
 The design will consist of two components - the controller and the datapath.
